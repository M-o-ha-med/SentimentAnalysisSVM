the resurgence of independent films . \\nmade on a shoestring budget of $1 . 2 million , with then relatively unknown actors , it is a provocative , thoroughly original drama . \\nthe film mostly focuses on the four central characters , all in their late 20's-early 30's . \\nann ( andie macdowell ) , an unfulfilled housewife , is married to john ( peter gallagher ) , an insensitive lawyer , who , unbeknownst to her , is having an affair with her younger sister , cynthia ( laura san giacomo ) . \\ncomplicating matters even worse is graham ( james spader , who won best actor at cannes ) , john's old college buddy , who comes to stay at their house . \\nann is absolutely won over by him , even though she clearly has stated that she has very little interest in sex . \\nthat is the set-up for the last hour of the picture , and since the film is entitled , \\\" sex , lies , and videotape , \\\" it is best to keep the rest of the story developments at bay so that they will come as a genuine surprise . \\ndirector steven soderbergh has proven to be a wildly offbeat filmmaker , ranging from the independent , to the mainstream ( 1998's \\\" out of sight \\\" ) , to the downright kafkaesque ( 1997's \\\" schizopolis \\\" ) . \\nhe is the type of director who obviously takes a lot of chances , and believes in the work that he does , and , \\\" sex , lies , and videotape , \\\" is probably his most confident , and maybe even best , to date . \\nthe performances are superb from all four leads , but macdowell stands out in what is probably the main character . \\nshe is always a very winning actress , but this is probably her most three-dimensional role that she has had ( with a close second being altman's 1993 mosaic , \\\" short cuts \\\" ) . \\nthe other parts are perfectly cast as well , from spader's ominous graham , to gallagher's self-involved john , to giacomo's outspoken cynthia . \\nthe final act of the film , especially , comes right out of left field , and turns out to be both shocking and oddly touching , and it would be criminal to give away the film's secrets . \\nsuffice to say that , through one powerful sequence , ann is able to somewhat come out of her shell , and john learns a valuable lesson about honesty , as well as deception . \\nthe film has one fault , however . \\nthe characters are almost all emotionally cold and isolated from one another , and often unlikable . \\nif there had been a few extra scenes with gallagher , it probably would have helped , since his relationship with macdowell isn't quite as explored as i would have liked . \\n \\\" sex , lies , and videotape , \\\" although minorly flawed , is still easily a brave and adult motion picture that is far more mature and honest about its subject matter than the usual film . \\nsoderbergh clearly knew what he was doing while he was making it , and the final product certainly proves this . \\n\",\n          \"in \\\" magic town \\\" , jimmy stewart is in peak form playing a pollster who heads to a \\\" perfect \\\" town to gauge their reactions on the sorts of issues that only poll-takers care about . \\nhowever , as time progresses , and he finds himself falling in love with the town ( and a woman ) , he begins to see that what he's doing is wrong . \\nthe plot is standard stuff , but that's not important . \\nin a film like this , it's the calibre of the actors that make or break it . \\nobviously , since stewart stars , that's practically a non-issue . \\nhe's great in the film , as usual . \\nthere's just something about him that always manages to be endearing , even when he's deceiving the town folk . \\nyou're always on his side , and you desperately want to see all of his goals come to fruitition . \\nthe film was directed by a longtime frank capra script-writer , and it shows . \\nthis is the type of feel-good picture that capra is famous for . \\nby the time \\\" the end \\\" shows up on screen , everything has been wrapped up very nicely . \\nthere are no loose ends , and virtually every character gets a happy ending ( those that deserve one , anyway ) . \\nin this age of cynicism , it's refreshing to see a movie so upbeat . \\n \\\" magic town \\\" is a delightfully entertaining motion picture . \\nif you believe all old movies are slow-paced , you'd be well-advised to check this one out . \\n\",\n          \" \\\" jaws \\\" is a rare film that grabs your attention before it shows you a single image on screen . \\nthe movie opens with blackness , and only distant , alien-like underwater sounds . \\nthen it comes , the first ominous bars of composer john williams' now infamous score . \\ndah-dum . \\nfrom there , director steven spielberg wastes no time , taking us into the water on a midnight swim with a beautiful girl that turns deadly . \\nright away he lets us know how vulnerable we all are floating in the ocean , and once \\\" jaws \\\" has attacked , it never relinquishes its grip . \\nperhaps what is most outstanding about \\\" jaws \\\" is how spielberg builds the movie . \\nhe works it like a theatrical production , with a first act and a second act . \\nunlike so many modern filmmakers , he has a great deal of restraint , and refuses to show us the shark until the middle of the second act . \\nuntil then , he merely suggests its presence with creepy , subjective underwater shots and williams' music . \\nhe's building the tension bit by bit , so when it comes time for the climax , the shark's arrival is truly terrifying . \\nhe doesn't let us get bored with the imagery . \\nthe first act opens with police chief martin brody ( roy scheider ) , a new york cop who has taken an easy , peaceful job running the police station on amity island , a fictitious new england resort town where there hasn't been a murder or a gun fired in 25 years . \\nthe island is shaken up by several vicious great white shark attacks right before the fourth of july , and the mayor , larry vaughn ( murray hamilton ) , doesn't want to shut down the beaches because the island is reliant on summer tourist money . \\nbrody is joined by matt hooper ( richard dreyfuss ) , a young , ambitious shark expert from the marine institute . \\nhooper is as fascinated by the shark as he is determined to help brody stop it -- his knowledge about the exact workings of the shark ( \\\" it's a perfect engine , an eating machine \\\" ) make it that much more terrifying . \\nwhen vaughn finally relents , hooper and brody join a crusty old shark killer named quint ( robert shaw ) on his decrepit boat , the orca , to search for the shark . \\nthe entire second act takes place on the orca as the three men hunt the shark , and inevitably , are hunted by it . \\n \\\" jaws \\\" is a thriller with a keen sense of humor and an incredible sense of pacing , tension , and horror . \\nit is like ten movies all rolled into one , and it's no wonder it took america by storm in the summer of 1975 , taking in enough money to crown it the box office champ of all time ( until it was unceremoniously dethroned in 1977 by \\\" star wars \\\" ) . \\neven today , fascination with this film is on par with hitchcock's \\\" psycho , \\\" and it never seems to age . \\nalthough grand new technology exists that makes the technical sequences , including several mechanical sharks , obsolete , none of it could improve the film because it only would lead to overkill . \\nthe technical limitations faced by spielberg in 1975 may have actually produced a better film because it forced him to rely on traditional cinematic elements like pacing , characterization , sharp editing , and creative photography , instead of simply dousing the audience with digital shark effects . \\nscheider , dreyfuss , and shaw were known actors at the time \\\" jaws \\\" was made , but none of them had the draw of a robert redford or paul newman . \\nnevertheless , this film guaranteed them all successful careers because each gave an outstanding performance and refused to be overshadowed by the shark . \\nscheider hits just the right notes as a sympathetic husband and father caught in the political quagmire of doing what's right and going against the entire town . \\n \\\" it's your first summer here , you know , \\\" mayor vaughn warns him . \\ndreyfuss , who had previously been seen in \\\" american graffiti \\\" ( 1973 ) and \\\" the apprenticeship of duddy kravitz \\\" ( 1974 ) gives a surprisingly mature , complex performance for someone who had literally only played kids and teenagers . \\nhowever , most outstanding is the gnarled performance by robert shaw as the movie's captain ahab , a performance sorely overlooked by the academy awards . \\nbordering of parody , shaw plays quint as a grizzled old loner whose machismo borders on masochism . \\nhe's slightly deranged , and shaw's performance is almost a caricature . \\nhowever , there is one scene late in the film , when he and brody and hooper are below deck on the orca comparing scars . \\nquint is drawn into telling the story of his experiences aboard the u . s . s . \\nindianapolis , a navy ship in world war ii that was sunk by the japanese . \\nhis tale of floating in the water for more than a week with over 1 , 000 other men while swarms of sharks slowly devoured them them is actually more hair-raising than anything spielberg put on screen . \\nshaw delivers the story in one long take , and it is the best acting in the film . \\nof course , we can't leave out the shark itself ; with its black eyes , endless rows of teeth , and insatiable urge to eat , it is basically the epitome of all mankind's fears about what is unknown and threatening in nature . \\na shark is such a perfect nemesis it is real -- having survived sinch the dinosaurs , great whites do exist , they can be as large as the shark in \\\" jaws , \\\" and they are a threat . \\nevery one of spielberg's subjective underwater shots makes us feel queasy because lets us see how we look to the shark : a bunch of writihing , dangling , completely unprotected legs just ready to be chomped into . \\nthe shark in \\\" jaws \\\" was actually a combination of actual footage and five different mechanical sharks ( all nicknamed \\\" bruce \\\" by the crew ) built to be shot from different angles . \\nmany have forgotten , but \\\" jaws \\\" was a sort of precursor to \\\" waterworld \\\" ( 1995 ) , a movie's who soggy production and cost overruns had universal studios worried about a bomb . \\nbut , as we can see now , spielberg overcame all the obstacles , and delivered one of the finest primal scare-thrillers ever to come out of hollywood . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n
